# 无限循环

1. 用while实现，方法1：
    ```sh
    while :
    do
        commands
    done
    ```
2. 用while实现，方法2：
    ```sh
    while true
    do
        commands
    done
    ```
3. 用for实现：
    ```sh
    for (( ; ; ))
    do
        commands
    done
    ```

Example:
```sh
TARGET=${SN}.AAA
while :
do
    wput ${TARGET} ftp://${UN}:${PW}@${TESTSERVER}/${SRVROOT}/STATINID4F/
    if [ $? != 0 ]; then
        echo "Failed to upload ${TARGET} file."
    else
        echo "${TARGET} has been uploaded successfully"
        break
    fi
    sleep 2
done
```
